## üó£Ô∏è About

>42_Inception is a Docker-compose project designed to streamline the creation of a robust LEMP stack, comprising Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP, all orchestrated seamlessly with WordPress. With this project, each service gets its own container, all operating within a dedicated Docker network, showcasing Docker as the key technology that powers this deployment. Additionally, the whole service is hosted within a dedicated Virtual Machine (using GCP Compute Engine service).

## üèó Arquitecture 

The system architecture for the "Inception" project is a comprehensive setup designed for system administration practice using Docker. It comprises various components and services orchestrated within a virtual machine environment. Here's a concise overview of the architecture:

- **Virtual Machine (VM):** The entire project takes place within a virtual machine, isolating and encapsulating the system components.

- **Dockerized Services:** The architecture involves multiple Docker containers, each serving a specific purpose. These containers are responsible for running various services, including NGINX, WordPress with PHP-FPM, and MariaDB. The containers are created using custom Dockerfiles, and each service operates within its dedicated container.

- **Volume Management:** Two volumes are utilized for data management. One volume holds the WordPress database, while the other stores the website files. These volumes ensure data persistence and separation.

- **Networking:** A custom Docker network connects the containers, facilitating communication and interaction between services.

- **TLS Encryption:** The NGINX container acts as the entry point into the infrastructure, serving via port 443. It provides TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 encryption, ensuring secure communication.

This architecture provides a robust environment for system administration learning, emphasizing Docker-based virtualization and the orchestration of multiple services within a virtual machine.
